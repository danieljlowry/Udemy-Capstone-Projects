# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Here you will find the collection of my (Daniel Lowry's) capstone projects! These projects were assigned from "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. 
These projects served as major milestone tests to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts introduced in the course at a certain point.
For example, the "P1_Online_Resume" project was a project to test myself on my understanding of the key HTML foundation concepts such as, but not limited to: header tags, images, and lists.

The purpose of this repository is to (of course) serve as a place to store my code, become more familiar with GitHub, and to document my journey through web development under this course.
I encourage you to view the various different projects and their components to see the stages of my progression. 
Every project has an associated README.md file inside to explain in greater detail what the project is about and what concepts are being demonstrated in the project.

Thank you for taking the time to view this repository, I really appreciate it!
And please message me on my various social media platforms linked to my GitHub account if you have any questions or just want to chat! ðŸ˜„
